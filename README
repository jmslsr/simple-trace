Simple Trace is a Python implementation of traceroute intended for operational support of network devices.  The output contains only IP addresses, giving a simple way to redirect the output to a file to be used in other tools.  A good example is to run the list through nmap to see how to access devices.

Usage:

simple-trace.py [options] hostname

Options:

-m, --max-hops: max hops before giving up (default 30)

Examples:

$ ./simple-trace.py 8.8.8.8
192.168.1.1
69.253.0.1
68.85.153.161
